# Postscript
The initial idea for creating this repository was to help someone who was poor in search online source be able to find out something they needed  
So I will list keywords under titles for the convenience of everyone searching  
You can search on github in this way:`in:readme [Something you want]`  
At least it makes me much more convinient  

Of course,the purpose of writing the readme file is to practice my English writing skills [:emoji]  
So if you think there are some points in improving my English, please don't be stingy with [Issue starting](https://github.com/oierxjn/note/issues/new/choose)
