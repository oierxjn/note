# A Notes Library

[中文简体(SChinese,zh)](https://github.com/oierxjn/note/blob/main/README_zh.md)  
The repository is used to sort all kinds of my notes  
I hope someone will benefit from these notes  
# Contents

# Postscript
The initial idea for creating this repository was to help someone who was poor in search online source be able to find out something they needed

You can search on github in this way:`in:readme [Something you want]`

Of course,the purpose of writing the readme file is to practice my English writing skills [:emoji]  
So if you think there are some points in improving my English, please don't be stingy with [Issue starting](https://github.com/oierxjn/note/issues/new/choose)
